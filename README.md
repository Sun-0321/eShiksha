# eShiksha

A platform that acts as a medium to conduct quizzes, assignments and exams. 

The portal is designed to be used both by faculties, who create the tasks and students, who perform them.

The progress of students can be tracked by the faculties at their side and reports can also be generated for every task once it is completed.
